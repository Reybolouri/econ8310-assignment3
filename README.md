# Assignment 3
## Econ 8310 - Business Forecasting

For homework assignment 3, you will work with [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), a more fancier data set.

- You must create a custom data loader as described in the first week of neural network lectures [2 points]
    - You will NOT receive credit for this if you use the pytorch prebuilt loader for Fashion MNIST!
- You must create a working and trained neural network using only pytorch [2 points]
- You must store your weights and create an import script so that I can evaluate your model without training it [2 points]

Highest accuracy score gets some extra credit!

Submit your forked repository URL on Canvas! :) I'll be manually grading this assignment.

Some checks you can make on your own:
- Did you manually process the data or use a prebuilt loader (see above)?
- Does your script train a neural network on the assigned data?
- Did your script save your model?
- Do you have separate code to import your model for use after training?
